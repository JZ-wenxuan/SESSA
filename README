This implementation does the following:

- We define *invariant* `Value` as being a constant, or defined by an hoisted instruction

- Hoist a instruction if all of its operands are *invariant* and:
  -  It is an arithmetric operation (in Performance mode only)
  - Or, it is a `Load` with src pointer not assigned to somewhere else in the frequent path
  - Or, it is a `Store` with dest pointer assigned only once in the whole function (in Performance mode only)

- Find all `Store`s that the every  hoisted `Load` depends on and:
  - Fix all uses of the hoisted `Load` by taking phi of all stored values
  - Clone **all hoisted instructions**, and insert them after every `Store` found (in Performance mode only)
  - Fix all uses of the cloned instructions' values by taking phi of them (in Performance mode only)
